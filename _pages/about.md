======
I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin - Madison, advised by [Prof. Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/). My research interests locate in machine learning, distributed system, and large-scale optimization.  
  
Previously, I was a member of [Graphics Group](https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/) at UW-Madison, worked on robotics research with [Prof. Michael Gleicher](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/).
